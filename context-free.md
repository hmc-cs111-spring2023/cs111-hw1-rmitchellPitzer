# Context Free

##  Who is this programming language for?

I think it's for people who want to generate images/art using
written instructions.

## What is easy to do in this language? Why is it easy?

It's easy to produce images using written grammar, so patterns or
designs can be easily repeatable. This is because the user can 
define new shapes and render them using the language.

## What is hard to do in this language? Why is it hard?

It is somewhat hard to do specific/intricate designs? For instance, a
line would need to be defined with an x/y coordinate, rotation, and length/width.
A comparable alternative would be using the pen tool in photoshop, so while
art and designs can be produced using written grammar that can be easily understood and
manipulated, it can be time consuming compared to alternatives.

## How did you learn how to program in this language?

I looked at the examples provided and the documentation on github.

## What is the underlying _computational model_ for this programming language? 

_We don't yet have a great definition of the term "computational model". 
For now, try to come up with the clearest, most concise explanation of what 
happens when a ContextFree program runs._

I think it renders it out as a photo on the right side, and also checks for
any syntax/compile errors.



## What do you think is interesting about the ContextFree program you wrote?

It outputs my name! I'm not sure the prompt said to keep it simple/don't write
any functions. I like that I used some of what was given in the welcome screen.
It's 10:44 Pm this is due in less than 2 hours lol.
